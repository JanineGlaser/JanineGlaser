## About me
I´m Janine but people call me _Jeanny_. I live in the south of Germany with my 2 dogs _Lilly_ and _Lou_. 

During my 35 years of living I did all kind of jobs. 
For example: 
- service (weddings)
- bartender 
- vet assitant
- costumer service / in and outbound
- military

Now im here learning something new and hopefully be able to reach my dream one day.

- meet my friends for lunch or dinner 
- take little trips to the beach
- visiting traditional festivals
