Welcome to my first GitHub :)
About me
I´m Janine but people call me Jeanny. I live in the south of Germany with my 2 dogs Lilly and Lou. During my 35 years of living I did all kind of Jobs. For example: Service, Vet assitant, costumer service / in and outbound, military, weekend markets.
Now im here learning something new and hopefully be able to reach my dream one day.
MY DREAM
my dream is it to be able to live and work in Thailand, most probably in Bangkok. My goal is it to work for E-Sports Bankok one day. 
In my free time I like to play video games like Valorant, go for walks with my dogs, learn languages, build Lego
Those are my hobbies in Germany, when im in Bangkok its a bit different, because then I like to go out in Bars and listen to live music, meet my friends for lunch or dinner, take little trips to the beach

I hope this gives you a bit of an Idea about me, I´m open for any kind of questions.
